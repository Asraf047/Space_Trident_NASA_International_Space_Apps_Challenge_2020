# NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2020 (Khulna_Mohakash_Create)
## Summary
The Space Trident is a modified version of the existing planetary geology toolset that deals with two major aspects: firstly, comes the structural modification of the toolset for better maneuverability and secondly, a proper coating to protect it from terrestrial radiation. The Space Trident have 3 major sections: Extension Handle, Stem &amp; Tool Heads. With a single extension handle &amp; stem, by varying the tool heads, explorers can use 4 different important tools (Rake, Small scoop, Large Scoop, Trenching Tool). This reduces the gross weight to be carried by the lander. The fitting mechanism is newly proposed, and very simple to perform. A secondary handle is also proposed for better handling.
## How We Addressed This Challenge
Humans last step on the moon was in 1969 to 72's Apollo missions. It consisted of a series of landings onto the lunar surface. From Apollo mission 11 to 17, Astronauts collected different samples of lunar surface and brought them back to the earth. The common geology tools they used to collect the samples are: the rake, hammer, scoop, drive tube etc [1]. To improvise a new tool for them, our plan was to modify the previously used tools as it will provide us additional time to work on the weaknesses of the current resources and less expenses to be done on the massive testing of new toolset. Hence, We have developed a toolset by modifying the tools used by the astronauts in Apollo missions by NASA. Structural changes to these sections have reduced dead-weight and simplified mobility and ease of working for the explorers.
## Design Facility:
The 3D model of the toolset named Space Trident is designed with three main parts: Extension Handle, Stem & Tool Heads. For the design of common extension handle of the tool-set, a shaft made up of Aluminum Alloy-T6 was used. There is a T-handle and a Secondary handle added to the design which incorporates Aluminum Alloy 6061 properly grooved for better gripping experience. A slider at the bottom of the extension handle enables good adjustability of the tool. In the Stem section, a shaft reinforced with steel is used as the common stem of the toolset. There is an angle locking mechanism at the bottom where the tool heads (Scoop Buckets, Rake Bucket, Trenching Tool) can be locked by simply pulling the lock pin and setting the head in the socket designed at the angle locking plate. The attachable tool heads for this design are: Small Scoop, Large Scoop, Rake and Trenching Tool. These are also made up of Stainless Steel and Aluminum Alloy.


## Setup Process Breakdown:

§ Put the stem in the socket of extension handle

§ Lower the slider to lock the joint

§ Pull the pin in angle locking plate

§ Slide the tool head in the socket of angle locking plate

§ The tool is ready to work on the outer planetary surface!



## Solution Breakdown:



1.    Extension Handle

The idea of extension handle was considered because it saves additional masses for separate long handles and is well suited with the tool heads mentioned earlier. Rake, Scoops, Hammer, Trenching Tool etc. which was proposed and used in Apollo missions.[2]



2.    The Stem

In light of the last Apollo mission, We had noticed that, though detachable scoops and rake saved mass but the stems connected with each tool were mass consuming. we decided that instead of separate stem attached tool heads, there will be a common stem/shaft. Hence we removed the extra stem section on tool heads and used a common stem/shaft adjustable with the extension handle via a slider. At the bottom of the stem there is an angle locking mechanism added for working in various position. Then, at the bottom of the angle locking plate, there is an socket for the installation of the tool heads like: small scoop, big scoop, trenching tool & Rake. This new connection mechanism is very simple. Just pull the pin, fit the tool head in the socket and after freeing the pin, the spring will push back the pin in the locking position. Now, due to this change in the design for mass reduction is that we separated the stem and the scoop bucket. The scoop bucket can be adjusted with the stem. Now for the rake use, the astronaut will simply have had to replace the scoop bucket with the rake bucket. Similar way, both small and large scoops and trenching tool can be used with just single stem separately without having a separated stem for each tools which increases the total carrying weight for the lander. Thus, we can ensure lesser weight to be shipped via spaceships.



3.    T handle & Secondary handle

Beside having the T handle at the top, We have added an extra element on the common shaft of the extension handle which is the secondary handle. This handle is pivoted at a point of the main shaft and also able to rotate around the main shaft. Furthermore, in our proposal the T-handle is designed by following the tool catalogue of John Space Center and the handle diameter was increased for better handling as suggested by recent researches [3]. After practically experimenting with modified shovel shaft with a secondary handle for better maneuverability, We believe, Having this section will provide better maneuverability and handling of the whole tool for the astronaut. As a result of which, he/she will be able to collect more samples within the precious time he/she has on the surface of other planets.



4.    Double Layer Coating

We all know that in space, everything is highly exposed to solar radiation. Comparatively to Earth’s atmosphere, this radiation intensity is higher on other planetary surfaces. As a consequence, though we want to maintain a cycle of reusability of the tools by members of consecutive expeditions instead of allocating new tools every time, we seem to fail. The radiation causes plasma pollution on the metal body, thus when left on a planet, it decays within the timeline for new explorers to come. To solve this issue, following the material study of MATERION, we have used an outer AR coating (Anti-Reflective) of MgF2 and an inner coating of Aluminum doped Zinc Oxide (AZO coating). A type of combination like this is used on artificial satellite panels for longevity. [4]






## Applicability and Feasibility:



Economic Feasibility: As the design is an amplification of an existing model of NASA in practice, the value of the question of feasibility is lowered. However, We want to manufacture (The design is already ready for manufacturing) the toolset and test it in the NASA space simulation centers.

Now, what our modification achieved is better usability and sustainability of the tool-set at the same or nearly same price. Thus, it contributes in better mission results, better collection of geological samples at a significantly feasible price.



Company Image: The longer a product can last, the better the company name becomes. It has been a long cherished dream for explorers to be able to reuse the tool-sets left by previous explorers on the surface of the target planet as a result of which, investments would have a lower curve and projects could be continued from where it was left off. Since, we are using a double layer coating with strong resiliency against plasma formation just like the materials used on artificial satellites, the degree of survival of the tools will be undeniable. Therefore, it is a win-win situation for all.

How We Developed This Project
We are a team of very passionate people and were following NASA's Upcoming Artemis Mission for sending human to Mars. We also roam about the tools and equipment's that astronauts use. As we saw this challenge in Space Apps, we got inspired to do some practical stuffs as NASA might use or notice this solution.



We started doing some background researches. From the NASA Johnson Space Centre's Apollo Mission Tool Catalogue [1], we studied those models and recommendations[5]. We considered K. Young's [6] Desert RATS Missions recommendation of modifying the tools for lowering the center of Gravity. From, L.K. Anderson's study [3], we found that, increasing the diameter of the shafts and handles makes a improvement in the scope of better handling as recommended by the simulated astronauts. We also followed the Artemis tool development project 2020[7]. We considered their plan of modifying the previous tools instead of creating new concept models.

Finally, after a team braingasm session, we started doing the model. We designed the toolset in industrially recognized CAD modeling software 'Solidworks'. Beside, we practically experimented a modified shovel handle with a secondary handle for better maneuverability. As we felt this was really working for better maneuverability, we believed, it would do the same for astronauts in outer planet surface. After the completion of the whole design, we took the model in webgl and deployed it in a webpage so that people can view or visualize the toolset in an outer planet surface environment.



## Tools Used:

1. Solidworks
2. Unity Webgl
3. Blender
4. Visual Studio Code Editor




## After modifications, we have achieved the followings:

§ Reduction of weight of the toolset by using common stem instead of separate stem.

§ Better maneuverability by Secondary Handle

§ Increased Diameter of the T handle and shaft for better handling as recommended by researches

§ Easier setup mechanism

§ Radiation protective coating for later use in outer planetary surface. These are a double layer coating in which, the outer layer is made up of Anti-reflective (AR) MgF2 coat and an inner layer of Aluminum doped Zinc Oxide (AZO) coat.
